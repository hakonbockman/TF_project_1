TF_project_1

This project is based on the previous project Tflite-model-maker-example, tf_1, tf_2, tf_3. Some of the repositories are following tutorials very strongly, aswell as others was discontinued as I realized the approach was not excatly fitting my problemspace and dataset. 


To run the script please make sure to install Python 3 with a Tensorflow, tflite-model-maker and make sure to install every package regarding CUDA and cuDNN.
